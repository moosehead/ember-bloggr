             Everyone at HackerNews yelled at me when I asked a question, I'm kidding!",
             extended: "There are some great resources and I am going to turn this project into a home
             to find those places, as well as turning this project into a place to come back weekly and
             continue working incremently on new features building off the basics.  For now please see 
             the about page and checkout the basic code in Github on how to serve a Ember app via Rails."
